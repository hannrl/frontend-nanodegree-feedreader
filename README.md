# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing and included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). They even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and left an application with an incomplete test suite. I have completed the test suite.
